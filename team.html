    <h2>Yann Landry | Director of A/V</h2>
    <p>The only reason Yann wanted to be on the CUSEC team was to have his bio on the website. Now that this is done, he can go back to his daily interests of hockey, heavy metal, scuba diving and chocolate milk. He is also a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa who will proudly tell you that Computer Science > Software Engineering. This is his 4th CUSEC and he finally decided to jump on that organizing thing for the first time.</p>
