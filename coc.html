    <p>Sponsors and volunteers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, offensive clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a discriminatory environment.

    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

    <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

    <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue as well as any conference-related social events.</p>
