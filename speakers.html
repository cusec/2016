    <h2>Consequences of an insightful algorithm</h2>
    <p>Coders have ethical responsibilities. We can extract remarkably precise intuitions about people. Do we have a right to know what they didn't consent to share, even when they shared data leading us there? Balancing human needs and business specs can
      be tough. How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? In this talk, we look at examples of uncritical programming, & painful results of using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended. You'll learn practices for examining how code
      might harm individuals. We’ll look at how to flip the paradigm, for consequences that are better for all.</p>

    <h2>So what exactly does it mean to be a "Software Engineer"?</h2>
    <p>I'm still figuring it out, but this is my personal, biased opinion about what I think it means to be a software engineer in today's world. None of the classes I took in school prepared me for the human aspects of being a programmer, and I will cover three things I wish I'd known before I started working as a software engineer.</p>

I'll introduce you to a few of my closest friends (who aren't actually my friends, some aren't even alive) who have helped me understand what we do in ways you might not expect.

    <h2>Modern software engineering in practice</h2>
    <p>What are the building blocks that should be present in every modern software project? What are some of the non-technical challenges involved in building and maintaining a software engineering project? This talk explores some of the difficult problems that graduates will face when transitioning from students to full-time software engineers. The topic is explored from the perspective of a recently graduated student that's worked in a large company for 2 years and a small company for 1 year - me!</p>

    <h2>Visualizing process evolution</h2>
    <p>What actually happens when your code is run? Our programs are simple text documents composed of patterns of rules, but the processes they guide aren't nearly as well behaved. Function scopes are generated, data is plumbed through pathways, bits are
      shifted and applications are evaluated. There's a lot of ins, a lot of outs. It's a very complicated case. We can gain some insight into the process with console.log and step-through debuggers, but we're left to develop a full program simulation
      in our minds based only on the code we wrote and the tiny snapshots our debugger gives us -- effectively requiring a JS interpreter to be compiled into our wetware. This can make it somewhat challenging to reason about our work. We'll look at some
      ways of remedying this, starting with data structures and tiptoeing toward full programs. Your code is the DNA for a process: let's build an illustrated anatomy guide.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-6">
    <h2>Compilers in your pockets</h2>
    <p>Compilers provide an important link between high-level languages used by programmers and the low-level code needed for computer architectures. The FORTRAN compiler, developed in the late 1950s, was the first demonstration that a computer program could translate high-level code to efficient low-level code, thus freeing scientists and programmers from writing assembly code by hand. Although many of the same ideas persist today,  there have been important innovations, including the idea of a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, including JIT compilers for JavaScript, embedded in popular web browsers.</p>
    <p>In this talk I will introduce compilation in general, and then discuss the fundamental differences between static compilers, like those for FORTRAN; and dynamic JIT compilers, like those for Java and JavaScript. I will then discuss my research group's recent work in developing static and dynamic compilers for the array-based scientific language, MATLAB</p>

    <h2>Meet Laurie</h2>
    <p>Professor Laurie Hendren leads the Sable Research Group at McGill University. She received her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Queen's University, Canada and her Ph.D. from Cornell. She has been a professor at McGill since 1990, was made an ACM Fellow
      in 2010, was awarded a Canada Research Chair in Compiler Tools and Techniques in 2011, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2012. The Sable Research Group has previously designed and implemented Soot and associated tools for the
      analysis and transformation of Java. For the last five years the group has been developing McLAB, a framework for compiling and executing MATLAB and extensions of MATLAB. In addition, she is currently part of a multi-disciplinary team developing

    <h2>Automated verification: is it for real?</h2>
    <p>The software industry has been plagued by bugs from its very inception.  All kinds of remedies have been proposed but, of course, the most popular remains thorough testing.  Model checking invented in the 1980s by Clark, Emerson and Sifakis offers the hope for a more rigourous automated checking of software correctness.  Among practitioners this has often met with skepticism.  In this talk I will review what model checking is and discuss prospects for its use in the software industry.</p>
